// sunspec is an API that allows navigation around SunSpec device maps.
//
// The key abstractions are: Array, Device, Model, Block and Point with
// Arrays being collection of Devices, Devices collections of Models and so
// on. At the lowest level are Points which provide for strongly typed
// access to blocks of 16 bit registers.
//
// The API is intended to be backed by different physical implementations, including:
//
//  * Modbus RTU/TCP (for purposes of connecting to remote devices)
//  * XML (for purposes of data interchange)
//  * memory (for purposes of testing)

// A Point is block of one or more 16 bit registers that can be mapped
// onto a value of a golang type of the correct shape.
//
// A Point is initially in an error state meaning its Error() method yields a
// non-nil value. While in the error state, any attempt to access the value of
// the Point will result in a panic. The error state is cleared by successfully
// reading the value of the Point from the physical device (using Block.Read) or
// by successfully setting its value with one of the Point setter methods.
//
// A program can assume that, immediately after a successful call to Block.Read(),
// then all Points that were either implicitly or explicitly specified by
// the arguments to Block.Read() were successfully read and hence will
// not be in an error state.
//
// If a program cannot prove that a Point is not in an error state, then
// the error state should be checked by calling Error() method prior
// to attempting to access the value of the Point.
//
// A Point can return to an error state if a related scaling factor is read
// (without reading the Point itself) or if the value of a related scaling
// factor is changed by calling one of its setter methods. One implication of
// this behaviour is that if you need to modify a value and its related scaling
// factor, you should always modify the related scaling factor first.
//
// Points also know how to apply scaling factors. If the ScaledValue() method is
// called for a Point with a 16, 32 or 64 bit numeric register type, then the
// register value will be multiplied by 10^scaling factor to produce a float64
// result containing scaled value of the Point's register value. Note that
// ScaledValue() will panic if either the Point or its related scaling factor
// Point are in an error state.
//
// A note about use of panics in the definition of this interface
//
// The intent of extensive use of panics in the definition of this interface is
// to permit detection of unsafe access to data without requiring each and every
// call to be guarded with an error check which, in a correctly written program,
// will not be required.
